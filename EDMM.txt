.helpwy Hey! On your initial contact you said the phrase "with you". There is absolutely no need to say that. When you speak to me on the frequency I certainly know, that you are "with me". An initial call shall include the following items: München Radar, CALLSIGN, Current Altitude or FL, cleared Altitude or FL (when climbing/descending), Assigned Speed (if you have an assigned speed/Mach from the previous controller). No more, no less, and definitely no "with you". For example: "München Radar, DLH414, FL146, climbing FL190, speed 250"
.helpcx Hey! Maybe you noticed that I gave you a handoff to a frequency that is not displayed in the controller list of your pilot client. The reason is that this frequency is cross-coupled - that means coupled together with another frequency this station covers. We do that to be more flexible when doing spontaneous station splits. To ensure this we would ask you to really contact the frequency you heard given by the controller, thanks!
